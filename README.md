# ABOUT THE PROJECT

Server written in python using flask framework. This server connects to the MySQL database and is responsible for HTTP with the application. The application is written in android studio. It is a control panel and user registration. During registration, an HTTP request (POST type) is sent to the server, which then sends data to the MySQL database. When the mobile application receives the status that registration was successful, we are redirected to the panel. Enter your login and password there, then click Login. In this way, we send an HTTP request to the server, which checks whether the given account exists. If there is, we are redirected to the list of events. Then the given user can delete or delete events. List of used tools: MySQL relational database, flask server, mobile application in android studio (java).
